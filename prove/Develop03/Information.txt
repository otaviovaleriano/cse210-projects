The Program class: This class contains the Main method, which is the entry point of the program. In the Main method, we create an instance of the Scripture class, passing the reference and text of the scripture as arguments. Then, we create an instance of the Game class, passing the Scripture instance as an argument. Finally, we call the Start method of the Game instance to start the game.

The Scripture class: This class represents a single scripture from the Bible. It has three properties: Reference, Text, and Words. The Reference property stores the reference of the scripture, such as "John 3:16". The Text property stores the text of the scripture, such as "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." The Words property is a list of Word objects, representing the individual words in the scripture text. In the constructor of the Scripture class, we split the text into individual words, create a Word object for each word, and add it to the Words list.

The Word class: This class represents a single word in the scripture text. It has two properties: Text and Hidden. The Text property stores the text of the word, and the Hidden property is a flag indicating whether the word is hidden or not. In the constructor of the Word class, we set the Text property to the value passed as an argument, and the Hidden property to false.

The Game class: This class represents the game, with methods for starting and playing the game, as well as for hiding random words and displaying the scripture text. It has two properties: scripture and random. The scripture property is a reference to the Scripture object passed as an argument to the constructor of the Game class. The random property is an instance of the Random class, used for generating random numbers.

The Start method: This method is called to start the game. It first displays the reference of the scripture. Then, it enters an infinite loop, where it calls the ReadLine method to wait for the user to press enter, calls the HideRandomWords method to hide a random number of words in the scripture, and calls the GetDisplayText method to display the current state of the scripture text.

The HideRandomWords method: This method is called to hide a random number of words in the scripture. It generates a random number between 1 and the number of words in the scripture, and then hides that number of randomly selected words by setting their Hidden property to true.

The GetDisplayText method: This method returns the current state of the scripture text, with hidden words replaced by underscores. It loops through the list of Word objects in the Words property of the Scripture object, and appends either the text of the word or an underscore, depending on whether the Hidden property of the word is true or false.
